# Keyboard Layout Simulator

Try QWERTY, Dvorak, and Colemak in your browser with typing practice and an on-screen keyboard.

**[Open keyboardlayout.app](https://keyboardlayout.app/)**

## Try a layout

- [QWERTY](https://keyboardlayout.app/)
- [Dvorak](https://keyboardlayout.app/dvorak)
- [Colemak](https://keyboardlayout.app/colemak)

Selecting a layout updates the URL, so you can share a link that opens the intended layout. The simulator changes typing in its practice area; it does not change your computer's input settings.

On a phone or tablet, tap the keyboard docked at the bottom of the screen to explore each layout. Shift, Backspace, Space, and optional key hints work with touch; 123 switches to numbers and symbols, and ABC returns to letters. Space or the return arrow advances a completed word. A connected physical keyboard also works.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies, then run the development server:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Simulator routes live in `src/app/(tester)/`. Article content lives in `src/content/`; the reading layout and guide routes live in `src/app/(reading)/`. Keyboard diagrams use the same mappings as the simulator.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Checks

```bash
npm run build
npm run test:analytics
npm run test:typing
```

## Production and analytics

The canonical production domain is **https://keyboardlayout.app/**. Metadata, the sitemap, robots.txt, and analytics share `src/lib/site.ts`. Vercel deploys changes merged into `main` automatically. Preserve the configured legacy-domain redirects so existing links continue to work.

See [analytics documentation](docs/analytics.md) for event definitions and local verification. Localhost and preview traffic are excluded from production ingestion.
